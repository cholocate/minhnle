# Transparency and Commitment to a Framework

## Prologue: This website, why? 
The blogs and notes are really what matters in this website, the other sections are plainly for showcase, mostly for companies that has `Portfolio Website` linkage in their job applications, and a little bit for my own pleasure. Why these two sections stands out, and why I would soon to regard them as pebbles to my avalanches is quite simple: **They keep me accountable to maintain quality.** Of course this depends on your level of insecurity, I will explain that in a moment. 

## Accountable Platforms are Productive Frameworks
I have been maintaining notes, diary entries, and other forms of writing in Notion for the last two years. The leap from that to writing my thoughts over the blogs that are available for anyone feels like publishing a highschool project publicly on Youtube for everyone, though I doubt anyone cares and that's why I mentioned insecurity- **it feels like it's there, but it's not actually there**. That's the whole point, my productive framework for the last few years have been academic notes and self-reflections that exists on a very small scale of accountability- myself, even if I don't do it, who would know? So there you have it, that's the reason why I have this website set up, but why bother with the decorations? Why spent tens of hours on trying to set up this `Chakra-UI` wrapper over `Docusaurus` on a `React` framework? Simple, because if all problems are linear, then we wouldn't have this conversation in the first place. 

## Understanding Yourself is an Individual Millennium Prize Problem
Coupling with insecurities, perfectionism, narcissism, and many more double-edged personality traits, the question isn't how we can face our problems regardless of these obstacles, but **how we face our problems along with these obstacles**. To succeed in understanding what you stand for, where your passion lies, or who your soulmate is, to name a few, is to see yourself growing to be the change you want to see. The only way to grow is by reaching out, to others, to new environments, and *fail* over new things that you have tried out and reflect on yourselves over those painful mistakes. Of course, these problems are subjective to everyone, as we all define success differently. There are pointers however; approaches that is generally more positive than going blindly into life. 

1. **Transparency**: Effective against insecurities and narcissim. Always be honest about your progress, and reach out.
2. **Commitment**: Effective against inconsistencies, adaptability increases overtime if commitment expands to a larger scale. 

These two attributes alone had carried me through career changes and embarassing failures. As I carried these ideas throughout highschool and college, I find myself more humble and more understanding, it is what I defined personally to be '*Speak softly and carry a big stick'*. 

## TLDR
These blogs are my records of personal growth that I used as a productive framework to utilize my weakness and harness quality. It is also a platform to understanding one-self better, if we choose to do so.
