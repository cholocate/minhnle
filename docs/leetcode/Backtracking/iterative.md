# Iterative Backtracking
** Highly encourage getting familiar with the mechanics of recursive backtracking first before trying out the iterative version. ** 

**DISCLAMER:** For large scale problems, while it is generally faster to implement the solutions iteratively, one should also take into account the complexity of translating the problem into the structure required for iteration (maintaining different variables, knowing how to traverse with the Stack).
