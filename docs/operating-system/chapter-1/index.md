## OS Definition 
- A layer of software that manages computer resources per user/application's requests. 

### 3 roles of OS
- **Referee**: 
    - Partition resources for different applications on the same machine. 
    - Isolate applications from one another. 
    - Concerns: Resource Allocation, Isolation, Communication. 
- Illusionist
    - If I write a program I need not know the different specs of machines that is going to run my program. The OS will do this for me. 
    - The OS abstract the process of allocation and allow the program to be independent of the number of processors and available physical resources. 
    - Portability and Flexibility. 
- Glue
    - My application should be able to talk with other applications or processes if it is allowed to, and I should not be worried about how to talk with others. 
    - The OS provides a set of common services between applications, processes, and external devices.
